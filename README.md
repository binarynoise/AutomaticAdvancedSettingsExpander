# AutomaticAdvancedSettingsExpander
Automatically expands the advanced settings in the Settings app by hooking setInitialExpandedChildrenCount in PreferenceGroup.

Should work on all Android versions where the Settings app uses androidx.preferencess. Please report where it stops working so that I can edit the minSdkVersion.
